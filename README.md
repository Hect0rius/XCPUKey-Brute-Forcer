# XCPUKey-Miner
A Xbox 360 CPU key brute forcer and public miner, built using C, uses both CPU and OpenCL
Currently working on the front end of the pool and OpenCL varient, so please wait until I finish :)

What speeds are we looking at ?
Well on a raspberry pi version 2 b model, I got 86k hashes per second, expect larger hashes when
I get the cpu version done.

# Linux
To build on linux you need the following installed, on Ubuntu version do the following :
sudo apt-get install build-essential libjson0 libjson-dev libssl libssl-dev curl libcurl-openssl-dev

to make just run : make

# Windows
